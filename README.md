# BabyBella Value Iteration Project

This project was completed as a coding project for reinforcement learning (ECE595) taught by Dr. Eirini Elini Tsiropoulou at UNM. This project applies a value iteration algorithm to make a navigation like system in a grid world. It uses object oriented programming to treat the grid world as an object to better streamline the system and make it more adaptable to new grids of varying sizes and complexities.
